Ideas:

- Add a section on how to use the documentation locally
- Add a section on how to contribute to the documentation
- Add a section on how to use the documentation on ReadTheDocs
- Add a section on how to reproduce this documentation in a new project
- Include a dummy Python package to illustrate the documentation and how to reference functions, classes, methods, etc.
